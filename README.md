# Welcome to a Python Implementation of the Classic Shakespearian Insult Generator #

This project generates hysterical "Shakespearian" insults to the terminal. Many years ago, the original incantation was
around, written in C, and I took that code and wrote a screen saver for my X Window System environment on
SunOS/Solaris. Originally written in _Xlib_, I had a blast.

Having found this code in a newer version written in C++, I've written a version in Python that will serve as the
beginning of something glorious. Right now, it's just good fun.

## Overview ##

The insult generator is data-driven, with a small data set living in the _data_ directory. If memory serves, there are
larger data sets living out on the internet; over time I'll add them here. But basically, the function of this
program is to generate and save between 1 and 10,000 "Shakespearian" insults.

An insult is generated by putting in three words or hyphenated phrases between the tokens "Thou " and "!". These three
words are picked at random, one from each column of words that are supplied in the data file. After that, it's good
clean fun.
